#Stitched Up Dialogue Engine prototype
##1st test prototype in Angular 2

This is just a test at the moment!

###Notes:

I set this up according to Angular 2's [5 MIN QUICKSTART](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/quickstart.html), using [SystemJS](https://github.com/systemjs/systemjs), TypeScript & [lite-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lite-server) (by John Papa).

To run the compiler and serve the app in a browser:

* Open a terminal window in the root of the application folder and enter:
  * `npm run go`
  * You can stop it anytime with Ctrl-C

Get details about tsconfig.json from the official [TypeScript wiki](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/tsconfig.json).

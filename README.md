#Stitched Up Dialogue Engine test
##1st test in Angular 2

This is just a test at the moment!

###Notes:

I set this up according to Angular 2 '5 MIN QUICKSTART' - https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/quickstart.html

To run the app in a browser:

* Open a terminal window in the root of the application folder and enter:
  * `npm run tsc`
  * Leave this command running in the terminal window.
  * You can stop it anytime with Ctrl-C
* Open another terminal window in the root folder and launch live-server by entering:
  * `npm start`

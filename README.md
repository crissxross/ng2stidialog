#Temp Stitched Up Dialogue Engine prototype
##1st test prototype in Angular 2 beta.0

CEASED work on this repo.
This is just a test at the moment!

###Notes:

To run the compiler and serve the app in a browser, in your terminal type:
* `npm start`
* You can stop it anytime with Ctrl-C

I set this up according to Angular 2's [5 MIN QUICKSTART](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/quickstart.html), using [SystemJS](https://github.com/systemjs/systemjs), TypeScript & [lite-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lite-server).

Get details about tsconfig.json from the official [TypeScript wiki](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/tsconfig.json).
